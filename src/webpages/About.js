              <p>My name is Todd, and I built this website that you're seeing from scratch!</p>
              <p>As an active learner in coding languages, I aspire to freelance my skillset and developing interactive experiences that can inspire others.</p>
              <p>I consider myself as a creative, always pushing for new ways to learn and adapt in order to thrive in a given environment by shifting perspective.</p>
              <p>When I'm not in the ocean impersonating dolphins you can find me creating music, building computers, or learning game development!</p>
